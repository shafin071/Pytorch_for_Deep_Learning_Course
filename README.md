# Pytorch for Deep Learning Course

These are the hands-on coding exercises and examples covered in Udemy's [Pytorch for Deep Learning course by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning-with-python-bootcamp/)

I added further comments for some codes in the scripts for more thorough explanation

## Notable coding excercises:

### Artifical Neural Networks (ANN) with Pytorch:
  - Use ANN regression to estimate the cost of a New York City cab ride
  
### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Pytorch:
- MNIST image classification 
- CIFAR-10 image classification 
- Cat-Dog image classification 

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Pytorch:
- Time-series forecast for data from Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED): 
  - Forecast sales of Beer, Wine, and Distilled Alcoholic Beverages
  - Forecast Electricity and Gas Utilities Production
  
 ### Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Network with Pytorch and GPU CUDA:
- Using LSTM network for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Shakespeare-like text generation using a LSTM model trained on Shakespeare poems
